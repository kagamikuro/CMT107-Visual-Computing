Occurrence - 19A    Ac Yr - 2019/0    Welsh % - 0
Outline Description of Module:
This module aims to expand the students’ fundamental knowledge and practical understanding of the techniques associated with Visual Computing. Students will cover advanced topics in Computer Graphics, Geometric Modelling, Image Processing and Computer Vision, and will increase their understanding of the underpinning mathematical techniques.
 

On completion of the module a student should be able to:
1. Describe, evaluate and implement the concepts, techniques and underpinning technologies associated with Visual Computing.
2. Critically analyse the present capabilities and limitations of Visual Computing algorithms and techniques.
3. Critically assess the present state-of-the-art associated with specific aspects of Visual Computing.
4. Design and implement algorithms to exercise and test elements of Visual Computing.
5. Relate underlying mathematical techniques to the implementation of visual computing techniques.
6. Evaluate the computational effort required to perform operations associated with various algorithms.

How the module will be delivered:
This module will be delivered through a combination of online readings and videos, face-to-face lectures, supervised lab sessions, example classes and tutorials, as appropriate.

 

Skills that will be practised and developed:
Programming of advanced visual computing algorithms, including data handling.
Critical evaluation of the claims associated with new algorithms and methods.
Understanding of the computational burdens associated with different processing techniques.
Ability to evaluate and select appropriate methods depending on the intended application and context.

 

How the module will be assessed:
During this module, the students will implement a 3D graphics system and modify an image processing system to demonstrate their understanding of visual computing.

There will be two points of assessment in the module:

Coursework: the coursework will allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and practical skills and to apply the principles taught in lectures. (LO1~6)

Exam: a written exam (2 h) will test the student’s knowledge and understanding as elaborated under the learning outcomes.(LO1,2,3,5,6)


Students will be provided with reassessment opportunities in line with University regulations.
