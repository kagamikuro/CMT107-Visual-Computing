This assignment code contains algorithms for computing Grapgics and Image Processing, which Graphics part is in the [CMT107-Final project] folder and Image Processing part is in the [Image Processing] folder,and these projects should be built and run on the Intellij IDEA with jogl API and jdk1.8.0_221. Information about the features implemented for each part will be described as below:

Graphics(main method is in the Application class)
	1.Rendering system
	-UI design implemented
	-lighting system implemented(can choose lighting material and set lighting position )
	2.Navigation system
	- camera control by keyboard
	3.3D objects 
	-sphere and teapot from lab class
	-rugby object implemented base on the sphere object, by refactoring it's vertice and normal. 
	4.Texture mapping
	-texure mapping implemented correctly but due to some unexpected error it couldn't be shown in this appication,I will fix it in future. 


Image Processing(main method is in the Application class,press 'p' to do the processing)
	1.Harris corner detector algorithm
	-some relative filters implemented(average filter,sobel edge filter,and gaussian filter)
	-Harris algorothm implemented
	-image load and process implemented
